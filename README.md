## The Api For Scheduler

[Scheduler-Api](https://github.com/lighthouse-labs/scheduler-api)

## Overview

Interview Scheduler is a project built up from unfinished code provided by [Lighthouse Labs](https://github.com/lighthouse-labs) as part of their Web Development Coding Bootcamp. 

Utilizing React and tested via both Jest and Cypress, this app is one that would theoretically be used internally by Lighthouse Labs itself to manage appointments between interviewers and students. It is a Single Page Application, which allows one to **create**, **edit** and **delete** interviews.
